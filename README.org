#+TITLE: mxp-mac-grab.el

Grab links from macOS applications and insert them into Emacs.

This is inspired by [[https://github.com/xuchunyang/grab-mac-link.el][grab-mac-link]] and [[https://gitlab.com/aimebertrand/org-mac-link][org-mac-link]], but simpler, as I only really use Safari and the Finder (but it also supports Mail).

The main difference is perhaps that it uses JavaScript for Applications (JXA) instead of AppleScript.  This has two advantages:

1. It’s easier to include the code in Elisp, and you can directly copy it between Emacs and Script Editor.
2. It allows us to get a structured value back from the application, so we don't have to construct  strings with special markers and then remove them again in Elisp.

The downside is that there is very little documentation for JXA…

There is only one interactive function, =mxp-mac-grab-link=.  Not everything is fully implemented.  In particular, currently only single items are supported.
